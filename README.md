## IMPROVED_DCNN_FACE_RECOGNITION_WITH_PCA_COMBINATION
Face recognition with Deep convolutional Neural Network(s) in combination with PCA reduction 
_____
### Abstract
 > The aim here is to increase the accuracy and performance of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) in Face Recognition (FR). This is achieved by using the ORL faces dataset with 400 different faces of 40 classes of 10 images per class. The dataset encompasses faces from different people with different illumination, environment, pose and with and without glasses.   
> Experiments conducted with the proposed method for FR using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) obtained better results and effectiveness compared to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). CNN obtained F1 score of 99% while PCA obtained 94%. These results were obtained after 90 epochs.
____
### Introduction
> The idea behind an FR system is to give computers the ability to detect and recognise human faces. This is effortless to human beings but computers need to be trained. This can be performed in images and videos. Deep learning computer vision methods, algorithms and techniques have shown a significant improvement over the past years.
> FR systems are found at the airport in security systems, at the police, cellphones, for criminal identification and verification.
