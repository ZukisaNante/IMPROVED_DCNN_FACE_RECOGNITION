### Abstract
<div style="text-align: right"> > The aim here is to increase the accuracy and performance of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) in Face Recognition (FR). This is achieved by using the ORL faces dataset with 400 different faces of 40 classes. The dataset encompasses faces from different people with different illumination, environment, pose and with and without glasses.   
> Experiments conducted showed that Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) obtained better results compared to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). CNN obtained F1 score of 99% while PCA obtained 94%. </div>
